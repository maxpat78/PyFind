PyFind
======

This module provides a simple tool to search a directory tree for files
matching some criteria, in a way similar to GNU find.

A sample:
	from PyFind import Find
	
	# Finds all files greater than 1 MiB, created in the last 25 minutes,
	# whose name ends in '.py'
	for found in Find('.', '-size +1m -a -cmin -25 -a -name *.py').find():
		print found
		
Also, it provides some extension switches: -Xdate and -Xhour, to test date
and times in a more user-friendly way (and better than -xnewerXY).
